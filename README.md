# Imagery-Classification-System-Using-Brain-Signals-CE903-Module
 
The goal of this project is to create a motor-imagery classification system using Brain Signals. It is aimed at implementing filtering, feature selection, feature 
extraction on the signals. The pre-processed data is then fed into Machine Learning/Deep Learning models for training which is then used for predicting 
unlabeled data. The trained model could then be utilized for controlling a robot arm which is a highly useful device for people suffering from paralysis or severe 
neuro-muscular diseases. A Graphical User Interface has also been implemented which allows users to view the Models achieving highest accuracy and the accuracy achieved when we use the model for prediction. Furthermore, this paper also describes the methods in which the Project had been Managed and a description on the 
techniques we implemented and the results that were achieved.
